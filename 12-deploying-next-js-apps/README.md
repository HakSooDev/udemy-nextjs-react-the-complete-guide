## Deployment

### Two Deployment Options

#### 1. **Standard Build (next build)**

- Produces optimized production bundles and a SERVER-SIDE app
    - Note that this result requires NodeJS server while react app does not need this
    - This is why you cannot just take this output and put it on static host (not like React)
- Pages are pre-rendered (if possible) but NodeJS server is required for API routes, server-side pages and page revalidation
- Re-deploy needed if code changes or you do not use revalidation and need page updates

#### 2. Full Static Build **(next export)**

- Produces 100% static app (HTML, CSS, JS): NO NodeJS server required
    - deployment and hosting is easier because your host does not have to know NodeJS
- However, It does not support SERVER-SIDE feature
    - Does not work if your app uses API routes, server-side pages or wants to use page revalidation
- Re-deploy for all code and content changes

So if our app uses NextJS server side feature, we must go with option 1 since our host should be able to run NodeJS to support NextJS SERVER-SIDE feature.

However, if our app does not use it, option 2 may be good to use. 

### Deployment Steps & Considerations

1. Add page metadata, optimize code, remove unnecessary dependecies (Try to make app as small as possible)
2. Use environment variables for variable data (e.g. database credentials, API keys, â€¦)
3. Do a test build and test the production-ready app locally or on some test server
4. Deploy!

## Environment variables
Environment variables are variables that used to provide different configures in different environments. <br/>
They are typically in .env file or configure file.<br/>
However, it is important to be aware of that these values can often cause security issue.<br/>
For example, if unauthorized people can view the file, it will cause security issue. <br/>
In this case, if environment variables can be accessed by unauthorized people, you must be able to rule out such as managing accessing IP address.<br/>
Also, using hosting providers built-in environment variables will be good idea as well.<br/>
