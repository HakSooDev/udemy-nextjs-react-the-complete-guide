## Section 7: Optimizing NextJS Apps

Practiced how to optimize NextJs Apps.

- Next JS Head component
  - 
  It helps optimizing meta data (tags inside head section such as title, meta description) <br/>
  It helps setting up different pages with different meta data

- Next JS Image component 
  - 
  It helps optimizing image (cache, getting optimized small images, lazy loading by default, and so on)
  
- _document
  - 
   It may be useful if you want to edit initial html doc or add html tag outside of rendering range of NextJs.
